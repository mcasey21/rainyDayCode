# RainyDayCode

This repo is for my the code that I make when im bored, motiviated, learning, testing or just coding for the shxts and gigs
This is the home of my passion for coding, its full of random projcts and tests ( some finished and some not ).

P.S I started these random code tests but always kept them locally on my desktop but decided to add them to this repo 
    to show people the funky stuff that happens in my spare time
